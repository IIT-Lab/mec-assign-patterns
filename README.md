# Optimal Mobile Edge Computing Assignment Patterns

This repository contains the implementation of the optimization algorithm described in 

Alberto Ceselli, Marco Fiore, Marco Premoli, and Stefano Secci. "Optimized Assignment Patterns in Mobile Edge Cloud Networks". Technical Report, University of Milan, Dipartimento di Informatica, June 2017. Available at http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2017/08/6183.pdf

together with the synthetic dataset used to test the algorithm.

In "src" directory you find the source code, an example of Makefile and examples of scripts to run the algorithm.

In "data" directory you find the synthetic dataset used to test the algorithm: the distance matrices and AP demands in time.
